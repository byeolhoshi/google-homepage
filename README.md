Hi! Welcome to my first real html/css project. 
I've never really done something like this before, and it was challenging. 
I kept hitting road blocks, and each time I thought, "This has to be the hardest part" and then it just got harder! The roadblocks were around formatting and such. 
I think I would like to revisit and reformat this better in the future. There are definitely more impressive ways to do this. 
But for now, I think I am pretty proud with how it has turned out. 
Things I would like to do in the future: 
-Add links
-Redesign the buttons (I didn't really do much to them)
-Fix the footer formatting (this was the hardest part!)
-Fix the top left div's positioning
-Whatever's in the comment in the styles.css file that I didn't cross out yet.
